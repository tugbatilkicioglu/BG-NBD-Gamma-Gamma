#
# When we examine the 0th and 14th observations, they are both in the 'A' segment, but there seems to be a high
# difference between the two. Maybe segment 'A' can be divided into segments according to the rate situation. The 17th
# observation is in the 'A' segment and the 18th observation is in the B segment, but at values close to each other.
# Investigations can be made regarding such observations.
